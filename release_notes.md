# Loop Client Release Notes
This file tracks release notes for the loop client. 

### Developers: 
* When new features are added to the repo, a short description of the feature should be added under the "Next Release" heading.
* This should be done in the same PR as the change so that our release notes stay in sync!

### Release Manager: 
* All of the items under the "Next Release" heading should be included in the release notes.
* As part of the PR that bumps the client version, the "Next Release" heading should be replaced with the release version including the changes.
